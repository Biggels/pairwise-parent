# pairwise-parent
Choose a parent nickname by making pairwise comparisons

## Plan
1. Find/collect a comprehensive list of parent nicknames.
2. (Optional) Define a grammar from that list and use it to generate more options.
3. Create an app that allows me to make pairwise comparisons between nickname options. It should choose matchups most likely to produce useful information and store the results of each matchup in a database for persistence.
4. Rank the options based on the results of the pairwise comparisons.
